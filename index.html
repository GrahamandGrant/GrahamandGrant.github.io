	  	What is the Warmbrella? (Home Page) 
	  </h4>
	<p>The Warmbrella is everything you want from an umbrella, regardless of the weather conditions. The heat blasting technology keeps you warm while traveling through rain, snow, and everything  in between. The water and pressure resistant top keeps you safe during hail storms and dry during downpours of rain. Live in a place with large amounts of wind? Warmbrella has you covered- with micro blasts of air in the circumference of the frame that keeps out wind and the rain that comes with it.

		<h4>Design</h4>
		<p>
		Warmbrella is masterfully designed in order to create the perfect umbrella for any situation. The fiberglass shaft and ribs make the entire tool lightweight, yet weighted enough to keep from being battered by heavy winds. A comfortable rubber handle allows for a sturdy grip by any age or size, while also containing the micro heater/fan that powers our micro heatblast technology. Opening the Warmbrella is easy with our built in pressure sensor in the handle- simply squeeze firmly on the handle to open the umbrella.  The canopy frame contains micro holes through which burst of heated air prevent sideways wind and rain, while keeping you warm when traveling. The conpoy itself is made from a water and pressure resistant acrylic, that contains a fire resistant finish. In the base of the handle is a USBC charging port which allows for a 1 hour charging time, and the battery can last up to 5 hours of use.
